<h1>DEAR MUSIC_co</h1>
<p><i>Principles & Laws</i></p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h2>

<p>DEAR MUSIC_co is not a factory.<br>
It is a space of creation, protection, and truth.</p>

<p>We believe that art is born from emotion, not pressure.<br>
That identity is not something to be erased, but something to be refined.<br>
That growth should never come from fear.</p>

<p>We do not create idols.<br>
We accompany artists.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>CORE PRINCIPLES</h2>

<div class="section">
<h3>1. Emotional Honesty</h3>
<p>At DEAR MUSIC_co, emotions are not weaknesses.<br>
They are the foundation of music, performance, and storytelling.</p>

<p>Artists are encouraged to express vulnerability, sensitivity, and personal narratives — without being forced to expose what they are not ready to share.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>2. Artistic Freedom</h3>
<p>We respect individuality.</p>

<p>Each artist keeps their personality, their voice, their style, and their pace.<br>
Concepts are built with artists, not imposed on them.</p>

<p>No member is asked to abandon who they are to fit an image.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>3. Protection First</h3>
<p>Artists come before content.</p>

<p>Physical health, mental well-being, and personal safety are non-negotiable.<br>
Any form of harassment, humiliation, manipulation, or abuse is strictly forbidden.</p>

<p>Respect is the base of all relationships within the agency.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>4. Growth, Not Perfection</h3>
<p>We do not expect perfection.<br>
We value effort, sincerity, and evolution.</p>

<p>Mistakes are part of the process.<br>
Learning is encouraged.<br>
Comparison is discouraged.</p>
</div>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>AGENCY LAWS</h2>

<div class="section">
<h3>Law 1 — Respect Is Absolute</h3>
<p>Every artist, trainee, and staff member must be treated with dignity.<br>
Disrespect, discrimination, or intimidation will not be tolerated.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>Law 2 — Consent Is Essential</h3>
<p>No activity, concept, performance, or exposure will be forced.</p>

<p>Artists have the right to say no.<br>
Silence is never considered consent.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>Law 3 — Identity Is Protected</h3>
<p>Names, images, and personal information are handled with care.<br>
Privacy is respected at all times.</p>

<p>Artists are never reduced to numbers, visuals, or trends.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>Law 4 — Communication Is Open</h3>
<p>Artists can speak.<br>
Artists can ask.<br>
Artists can express concerns without fear.</p>

<p>Transparency is a responsibility of the agency.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h3>Law 5 — Art Has Meaning</h3>
<p>Music, visuals, and performances must carry intention.<br>
We do not create empty concepts.</p>

<p>Every era tells a story.<br>
Every project has a purpose.</p>
</div>

<div class="divider"></div>

<h2>FINAL STATEMENT</h2>

<p>DEAR MUSIC_co exists for those who feel deeply,<br>
for those who were never meant to fit simple boxes,<br>
for those who believe that art can be both beautiful and honest.</p>

<p>This is not a place to disappear.<br>
This is a place to become.</p>

<p><i>To the next us — dear. 🤍</i></p>
